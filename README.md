## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://github.com/mcpiscript/Planet/raw/master/screenshot.png)

The Minecraft Pi: Reborn mod is a great addition to the game. However, as fun as it can be, there is a big problem. The built-in launcher is too annoying. You have to type in every single field to just remember that you forgot to turn on a teeny little flag. **Planet fixes that.**
Instead of making you type in every single field, Planet lets you write it one time, auto-save, and forget for the rest of your life. With Planet you can even edit the world names and it supports the newly-introduced Reborn AppImages. It is also maintained unlike the other launchers.


## Built With

* The GUI is made using the PyQt5 Qt binding for Python, and additional widgets from qtwidgets.
* Big thanks to `pypresence` developers, for making such a good interface to Discord RPC.
* Thanks to `pyqtdarktheme` and `darkdetect` for awesome Qt theming tools.
* Pillow was used for skin manipulation
* PyNBT is used for the built-in MCPIedit
* `click` is an awesome interface, unfortunately, not to handle autoclickers, but for CLI interfaces used in the texture pack tool.

- Use jMCPIL if you're using a DEB install on a distro other than Debian Bullseye
- Use the built-in launcher if you like to fill in things constantly
- Don't use pipan, it's a dirty prototype, not a working launcher
